            <h1 style="color: rgb(27, 25, 25);">Makar Sankranti.</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">Makar Sankranti is a major Hindu festival celebrated across India, including Uttar Pradesh, with great joy and enthusiasm. It marks the sun’s transition into the zodiac sign of Capricorn (Makar Rashi), symbolizing the end of winter and the beginning of longer, warmer days. Celebrated every year on January 14th, it is one of the few Indian festivals based on the solar calendar.

In Uttar Pradesh, Makar Sankranti is also known as Khichdi Parv, as it is traditional to cook and eat khichdi (a dish made of rice and lentils) on this day. People also donate khichdi, blankets, sesame seeds (til), jaggery (gur), and clothes to the poor, believing it brings blessings and good karma.

A major highlight of the festival in cities like Prayagraj (Allahabad) is the ritual bath at the Triveni Sangam, where millions of devotees gather to take a dip in the holy rivers — Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati. This act is believed to cleanse sins and bring spiritual merit.

People fly colorful kites, wear traditional clothes, and visit temples. Makar Sankranti celebrates harvest, charity, and new beginnings, making it a festival of gratitude, spirituality, and community harmony throughout Uttar Pradesh and India.</p>

               <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">Ram Navami is a major Hindu festival celebrated with great devotion across Uttar Pradesh, especially in cities like Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Ram. It marks the birth of Lord Ram, the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu, on the ninth day of Chaitra Navratri, which usually falls in March or April.

In Ayodhya, the celebrations are grand and deeply spiritual. Devotees take a holy dip in the Sarayu River, visit Ram Janmabhoomi Temple, and participate in bhajans, kirtans, and religious processions. Temples are beautifully decorated, and Ram Leelas (dramatic performances of Lord Ram’s life) are organized in many towns and villages.

People observe fasts, chant Ram Naam, and read the Ramayana. Homes are cleaned and adorned with flowers and rangoli. Children often dress as Ram, Sita, Lakshman, and Hanuman, bringing the epic stories to life.

In many parts of Uttar Pradesh, community feasts (bhandaras) are organized, and people offer prasad (holy food) to others. The spirit of devotion, righteousness, and truth associated with Lord Ram is remembered and celebrated.

Ram Navami in Uttar Pradesh is not just a religious event—it is a reflection of faith, culture, and unity, bringing people together in celebration of virtue and divine heritage.

               <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">Maha Shivaratri is one of the most significant Hindu festivals, dedicated to Lord Shiva, and is celebrated with great devotion and energy across Uttar Pradesh, especially in cities like Varanasi, Prayagraj, and Bareilly. Observed on the 14th night of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) in the month of Phalguna (February–March), the festival marks the divine marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati.

On this day, devotees wake up early, take a holy bath, and visit Shiva temples, offering milk, water, bel leaves, honey, and flowers on the Shivling. Varanasi’s Kashi Vishwanath Temple, one of the most sacred Shiva temples, witnesses huge crowds of pilgrims who chant “Om Namah Shivaya” throughout the night.

Many devotees observe a strict fast and stay awake all night, participating in jagarans (night-long prayers) and bhajans. It is believed that worshipping Lord Shiva on Maha Shivaratri with sincerity can wash away sins, bring peace, and lead to moksha (liberation).

Temples are beautifully decorated with lights and flowers, creating a spiritual atmosphere. The festival reflects the power of faith, self-control, and devotion.

Maha Shivaratri is not only a night of worship but also a celebration of cosmic union, spiritual growth, and divine energy in Uttar Pradesh and across India.

               <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">Diwali, also known as Deepawali, is one of the most important and widely celebrated festivals in India, especially in Uttar Pradesh.

Diwali is celebrated on the Amavasya (new moon) of the Hindu month Kartik, which usually falls in October or November.

The festival marks the return of Lord Ram to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile and his victory over the demon king Ravana.

In Ayodhya, Diwali is celebrated on a grand scale with Deepotsav, where lakhs of diyas are lit along the Saryu River, setting world records and attracting tourists from all over.

People clean and decorate their homes, make rangoli, wear new clothes, and worship Goddess Lakshmi and Lord Ganesha for wealth and prosperity. Families light diyas and candles, burst firecrackers, and enjoy delicious sweets like laddu, barfi, and chakli.

Diwali is not just a festival; it is a time of joy, unity, and celebration, bringing families and communities together in a spirit of happiness, light, and hope.
